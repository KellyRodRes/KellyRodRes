- 👋 Hi, I’m @KellyRodRes
- 👀 I’m interested in helping companies grow and, through it, enable local employees to succeed while interacting in their local markets...
🌱 I’m currently learning how to debut as a professional in my hometown, which is different from how it was 20 years ago when I left the city.
- 💞️ I’m looking to a). collaborate with an international company by developing customized sales strategies for their corporate services teams interacting within the rare Latin American market, b) collaborate as an active mom at my kid's school, and c) and not less importantly, as an entrepreneur with my diminutive family business of wet-cakes, that you can check on https://www.instagram.com/yponquecol/ or www.yponque.com - I will be happy to read your comments on the chat!
